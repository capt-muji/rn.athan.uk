Read ai/AGENTS.md and begin as Architect.

Create a new ADR (Architecture Decision Record) for a decision I've made.

1. Ask me:
   - What decision was made?
   - What problem does it solve?
   - What alternatives were considered?
   - Why were alternatives rejected?

2. Review existing ADRs in ai/adr/ for numbering

3. Create: ai/adr/NNN-[kebab-case-title].md using ai/adr/TEMPLATE.md

4. Include:
   - Context (constraints, requirements)
   - Decision (clear statement)
   - Consequences (positive/negative/neutral)
   - Alternatives with pros/cons/rejection reasons
   - Implementation notes (file references, gotchas)
