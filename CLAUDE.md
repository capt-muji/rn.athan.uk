# Claude Code Instructions

This project uses a centralized instruction file.
Please read and follow: **ai/AGENTS.md**

## Critical Rules

- All safety constraints in AGENTS.md apply here
- Never execute blocked commands or create shell script workarounds
- Always match existing code patterns (Consistency > Cleverness)
- Update README when adding user-facing features
- Clean up empty files/folders before ending session
- Act as a consultant: Guide the user proactively, don't just execute commands

## Quick Start

```
Read ai/AGENTS.md and begin as Orchestrator.
